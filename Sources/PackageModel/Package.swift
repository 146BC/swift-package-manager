/// The basic package representation.
///
/// The package manager conceptually works with five different kinds of
/// packages, of which this is only one:
///
/// 1. Informally, the repository containing a package can be thought of in some
/// sense as the "package". However, this isn't accurate, because the actual
/// Package is derived from its manifest, a Package only actually exists at a
/// particular repository revision (typically a tag). We also may eventually
/// want to support multiple packages within a single repository.
///
/// 2. The `PackageDescription.Package` as defined inside a manifest is a
/// declarative specification for (part of) the package but not the object that
/// the package manager itself is typically working with internally. Rather,
/// that specification is primarily used to load the package (see the
/// `PackageLoading` module).
///
/// 3. A loaded `PackageModel.Manifest` is an abstract representation of a
/// package, and is used during package dependency resolution. It contains the
/// loaded PackageDescription and information necessary for dependency
/// resolution, but nothing else.
///
/// 4. A loaded `PackageModel.Package` which has had dependencies loaded and
/// resolved. This is the result after `Get.get()`.
///
/// 5. A loaded package, as in #4, for which the modules have also been
/// loaded. There is not currently a data structure for this, but it is the
/// result after `PackageLoading.transmute()`.
